This project was done during the pandemic. It draws on topics from digital humanities where I import big corpuses of data, treat it and do all sorts of language analysis to understand what people exactly felt during the pandemic. This was one project in a series of project that I worked on to enable computers to essentially read and understand text like we do and understand their limitations and challenges.
