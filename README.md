This project was done during the pandemic. It draws on topics from digital humanities where I import big corpuses of data, treat it and do all sorts of language analysis to understand what people exactly felt during the pandemic. This was one project in a series of project that I worked on to enable computers to essentially read and understand text like we do and understand their limitations and challenges.

To open the project, you have to download Mathematica Player through this link: https://www.wolfram.com/player/
After downloading the player, upload the .nb file in this repository to open the interactive notebook using Mathemtica Alpha notebook.
